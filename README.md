###Life Simulator

python3 life5.py

press Left CTRL to start simulation

This simulates population genetics and how genetic material is 
passed around. The various genotypes result in different phenotypes 
being expressed. To visualise the different phenotypes based on the 
genotype different shapes and colours are used. The phenotypes expressed 
are either homozygous or heterozygous dominant.

The females are stationary and the males move around, this is to simulate 
open pollination of plants in the wild.

## gen_tree

python3 gen_tree.py

Select offspring to cross by clicking on 1st then 2nd parent. 
This will produce the next generation of offspring, you can then select 
the next two parents from that generation or look to back cross with a prior generation.

The purpose of this application is to highlight the difficulty in creating a stable line 
when you only have the phenotypical expression to go on.
